This repository contains the iOS app which allows users to:
- manage rooms, sensors and sirens.
- visualize istantaneous data coming from the sensors.
- visualize historical data points from the sensors in from of graphs and histograms.
- enable/disable alarm.
- stream HTTP and RTSP live cameras.
The app was developed using Apple's UIKit.
