The app was developed using Apple's UIKit and uses several libraries such as VideoLAN's VLCKit for the camera streaming and danielgindi's Charts for displaying historical data.

### Genesis
This repo is part of Omniscient, a project I made in collaboration with @my-rice for my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Engineering.
